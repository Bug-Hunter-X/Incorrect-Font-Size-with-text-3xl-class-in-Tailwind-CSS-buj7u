// Ensure that you have correctly imported Tailwind's base styles and any custom styles you have defined.
// You can do this in your main CSS file or using a CSS preprocessor like PostCSS.
// This may require configuring your Tailwind CSS build process correctly (postinstall, etc.).

//Then, to ensure the correct text size is applied, double-check the class names you're using. 
// For example, if you meant to use `text-2xl` instead of `text-3xl`, adjust it accordingly.

<div class="bg-gray-300 p-4">
  <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold underline">Hello world!</h1>
</div>
